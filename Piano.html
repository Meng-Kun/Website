    <h1>ABRSM piano examination system</h1>
    <img width=500 src=download.png>
    <a href="https://us.abrsm.org/en/our-exams/piano-exams/">The offical ABRSM website</a>
    <p>Marking schedule
        100 marks are required for a Pass, 120 for a Merit and 130 for a Distinction. A Pass in each individual section is not required to pass overall.
    </p>
    <h1>Exam sections<h1>
    <h2>Scales and arpeggios/broken chords (21 marks total)</h2>
    <p>Examiners will usually ask for at least one of each type of scale/arpeggio/broken chord etc. required at each grade and will ask for majors followed by minors within each type. They will also ask to hear a balance of the hand requirements and, in Grades 6–8, of the specified articulations across the requests as a whole. When asking for requirements, examiners will specify:
        • the key (including minor form – harmonic or melodic – in the Grade 6–8 scales) or the starting note
        • left hand or right hand, or hands together
        • the articulation (where chosen by the examiner)
        All scales, arpeggios and broken chords should:
        • be played from memory
        • be played in even notes (with the exception of the Grade 1 broken-chord pattern)
        • ascend and descend according to the specified range (and pattern)
        • be prepared legato, unless the syllabus specifies staccato (or both)
        • be played without pedalling
        Candidates are allowed to use any fingering that produces a successful musical outcome.
        Candidates are free to start at any octave, provided the required ranges are covered. For all ‘hands together’ requirements, the hands should be one octave apart, unless otherwise indicated.
        Arpeggios and dominant sevenths are required in root position only, except where otherwise indicated. Scales in thirds or a third apart should begin with the tonic as the lower note, while scales in sixths or a sixth apart should begin with the tonic as the upper note.
        </p>
    <h2>Scales requirements</h2>
    <img width=500 src=Scales.png>
    <h2>Pieces (30 marks for each pieces, total 90)</h2>
    <p>Programme planning: Candidates must choose one piece from each of the three lists (A, B and C) in each grade.
    </p>
    <h2>Sight-reading (21 marks total)</h2>
    <p> Candidates will be asked to play a short unaccompanied piece of music which they have not previously seen. They will be given half a minute in which to look though and, if they wish, try out all or any part of the test before they are required to play it for assessment. The table below shows the introduction of elements at each grade.</p>
    <img width=600 src=Sightreading.png>
    <h1>Aural tests (18 marks total)</h1>
    <h2>Aural test grade 1</h2>
    <p>A To clap the pulse of a piece played by the examiner, and to identify whether it is in two time or three time. The examiner will start playing the passage, and the candidate should join in as soon as possible, clapping in time and giving a louder clap on the strong beats. The examiner will then ask whether the music is in two time or three time. The candidate is not required to state the time signature.
            B To sing as ‘echoes’ three phrases played by the examiner. The phrases will be two bars long, in a major key, and within the range of tonic–mediant. First the examiner will play the key-chord and the starting note (the tonic) and then count in two bars. After the examiner has played each phrase, the candidate should sing back the echo without a pause, keeping in time.
            C To identify where a change in pitch occurs during a phrase played by the examiner. The phrase will be two bars long, in a major key, and the change will affect only one of the notes. First the examiner will play the key-chord and the tonic and then count in two bars. The examiner will play the phrase twice, making the change in the second playing, after which the candidate should state whether the change was near the beginning or near the end. If necessary, the examiner will play both versions of the phrase again (although this may affect the assessment).
            D To answer questions about two features of a piece played by the examiner. Before playing, the examiner will tell the candidate which two features the questions will be about. The first will be: dynamics (loud/quiet, or sudden/gradual changes); the second will be articulation (smooth/ detached).</p>
    <h2>Aural test grade 2</h2>
    <p>A To clap the pulse of a piece played by the examiner, and to identify whether it is in two time or three time. The examiner will start playing the passage, and the candidate should join in as soon as possible, clapping in time and giving a louder clap on the strong beats. The examiner will then ask whether the music is in two time or three time. The candidate is not required to state the time signature.
            B To sing as ‘echoes’ three phrases played by the examiner. The phrases will be two bars long, in a major key, and within the range of tonic–dominant. First the examiner will play the key-chord and the starting note (the tonic) and then count in two bars. After the examiner has played each phrase, the candidate should sing back the echo without a pause, keeping in time.
            C To identify a change in either pitch or rhythm during a phrase played by the examiner. The phrase will be two bars long, in a major key. First the examiner will play the key-chord and the tonic and then count in two bars. The examiner will play the phrase twice, making the change in the second playing, after which the candidate should identify the change by describing it, or singing/clapping. If necessary, the examiner will play both versions of the phrase again (although this may affect the assessment).
            D To answer questions about two features of a piece played by the examiner. Before playing, the examiner will tell the candidate which two features the questions will be about. The first will be one of the following: dynamics (loud/quiet, or sudden/gradual changes), articulation (smooth/detached); the second will be tempo (becoming slower/faster, or staying the same).</p>
    <h2>Aural test grade 3</h2>
    <p>A To clap the pulse of a piece played by the examiner, and to identify whether it is in two time, three time or four time. The examiner will start playing the passage, and the candidate should join in as soon as possible, clapping in time and giving a louder clap on the strong beats. The examiner will then ask whether the music is in two time, three time or four time. The candidate is not required to state the time signature.
            B To sing as ‘echoes’ three phrases played by the examiner. The phrases will be two bars long, in a major or minor key, and within the range of an octave.

After the examiner has played each phrase, the candidate should sing back the echo without a pause, keeping in time.
            C To identify a change in either pitch or rhythm during a phrase played by the examiner. The phrase will be up to four bars long, in a major or minor key. First the examiner will play the key-chord and the tonic and then count in two bars. The examiner will play the phrase twice, making the change in the second playing, after which the candidate should identify the change by describing it, or singing/clapping. If necessary, the examiner will play both versions of the phrase again (although this may affect the assessment).
            D To answer questions about two features of a piece played by the examiner. Before playing, the examiner will tell the candidate which two features the questions will be about. The first will be one of the following: dynamics (loud/quiet, or sudden/gradual changes), articulation (smooth/detached), tempo (becoming slower/faster, or staying the same); the second will be tonality (major/minor key).</p>
    <h2>Aural test grade 4</h2>
    <p>A To sing or play from memory a melody played twice by the examiner. The melody will be within the range of an octave, in a major or minor key with up to three sharps or flats. First the examiner will play the key-chord and the starting note and then count in two bars. (If the candidate chooses to play, the examiner will also name the key-chord and the starting note, as appropriate for the instrument.) If necessary, the examiner will play the melody again and allow a second attempt (although this may affect the assessment).
            B To sing five notes from score in free time. The candidate may choose to sing from treble or bass clef. The notes will be within the range of a third above and below the tonic in the key of C, F or G major. The test will begin and end on the tonic and will not contain intervals greater than a third.
